# 杂谈｜Prompt - Using AI Models！



使用生成式人工智能时，**输入的提示越好，得到的结果就越好**。



## Overall Tricks

- Be specific and unambiguous.
- Detail the role and task.
- Specify the format and style.
- Chat to refine the output.
- Practice and experiment.

### 1. Be specific

When crafting a prompt, it's crucial to be specific and clear about the information you want. Providing clear instructions helps the AI generate accurate and relevant responses.

**Instead of:** Tell me about AI

**Use:** Explain the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning.

### 2. Set a format

Defining the format you want the output in can help AI deliver a more accurate and useful response. Specify whether you want a list, paragraph, bullet points, or any other format.

### 3. Multi-step prompts

For complex queries, you can use multi-step prompts that break down the question into smaller parts. This helps AI tools to provide more comprehensive answers.

First, explain supervised learning. Second, describe unsupervised learning. Finally, discuss reinforcement learning and its applications.

### 4. Instruct the perspective

To control the perspective of the generated text, specify whether you want the response in the first, second, or third person.

Write a paragraph on machine learning in the first person.

Specificity is key! The AI tool will make an assumption on any points you don’t clearly explain, so before you start, think about what it is you are trying to achieve. 

### 5. Try and refine

There is no hard science to good prompting. Instead, approach it as a process of trial and error:

1. Formulate a relevant prompt.
2. Evaluate the output and think about whether it has achieved what you were hoping for. Has it fallen short of your expectations?
3. Enhance the clarity of the prompt.
4. Repeat the process to iteratively improve your prompt's effectiveness.



## The Structure of a Good Prompt

A good prompt has 4 key elements: **Role**, **Task**, **Requirements** and **Instructions.** Let's take a look at each one in depth.

### 1. Role

What role or persona do you want the AI tool to assume? Prompts starting with "act as..." or "pretend to be..." will instruct the AI to behave as a person or a particular process when creating its response. Setting a specific role for a given prompt increases the likelihood of more accurate information, when done appropriately.

Acting as a ...

- analyst
- teacher
- undergraduate student in [subject]
- professional in [discipline]
- expert in [subject]
- researcher in [subject]

### 2. Task

The task is a summary of what you want the prompt to do. There is a lot of creativity that comes into writing a great task. It can range from generating birthday gift ideas to creating game show questions with the content from your last lecture.

Be specific about the task’s objective. 

Create a

- summary
- description
- report outline
- video script
- revision timetable

### 3. Requirements

Writing clear requirements is all about giving as much information as possible to ensure your response doesn't use any incorrect assumptions. AI models make assumptions for any information that they don't have in the prompt. 

- Define what an output should look or sound like
  - use a formal/ informal tone
  - write short sentences
  - use academic English
- The format you want it in
  - table
  - list
  - summary
  - HTML
- Provide information on any conditions that will limit the assumptions made by the model

### 4. Instructions

Instructions will inform the AI how to complete the task. Instructions can include examples of how the output is supposed to look, steps it can follow, or any information to base its outputs on. Feedback on steps it has taken will improve this even further.

**Instead of:** Give me a list of ideas to save money as a student.

**Try:** Provide a bullet point list of money saving ideas for a university student in the UK, where the cost of rent and energy bills is fixed. Here is one example: make use of the resources available in the university library.
